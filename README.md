# p4-namespaces

A public repo for discussion of adding namespaces to the [P4
programming language](https://p4.org).

See [this Google
Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNC4t5NjAhzOhiC_DauiYrw80h1cXjZhshdRTuAPSnc)
for many thoughts on what such a namespace system might look like.

You are encouraged to use [Github
Issues](https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-namespaces/issues) on this
repository for discussion on this topic.

# This repo is for P4 language feature design discussions, not authoritative

The authoritative specification of the P4 language can be obtained
[here](https://p4.org/specs), and is maintained in source form in the
[p4-spec repository](https://github.com/p4lang/p4-spec).

This repository is for design discussions of adding a namespace
feature to the P4 programming language.  All statements made reflect
at most the opinions of their authors, and even they reserve the right
to change their minds later :-)

It is hoped that some of the results of this discussion will end up in
enhancements to a future version of the P4 programming language
specification, but as of 2021-Dec that is still only a hope.
