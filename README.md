# p4-namespaces

A public repo for discussion of adding namespaces to the [P4
programming language](https://p4.org).

If this is your first time learning about this proposal, below is one
recommendation on how to get started _without_ reading all of the
fairly long Google doc linked below.

Read these sections of the Google doc, totaling about 5 pages:
+ [Goals of a P4 namespace
  system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNC4t5NjAhzOhiC_DauiYrw80h1cXjZhshdRTuAPSnc/edit#bookmark=id.avxqvt6rf45a) 
+ [Non-goals of this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNC4t5NjAhzOhiC_DauiYrw80h1cXjZhshdRTuAPSnc/edit#bookmark=kix.8vwhepylnfng)
+ [New syntactic elements introduced by this
  proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNC4t5NjAhzOhiC_DauiYrw80h1cXjZhshdRTuAPSnc/edit#bookmark=kix.y3adl53ue6du)
+ [Short code snippet examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNC4t5NjAhzOhiC_DauiYrw80h1cXjZhshdRTuAPSnc/edit#bookmark=id.kujexs8tayd6)

A few complete P4 programs that use this proposal are given n a
subdirectory of this repo.  See [the README
there](examples/01/README.md).

You are encouraged to use [Github
Issues](https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-namespaces/issues) on this
repository for discussion on this topic.  Several issues have been
created, with the hope of fostering discussion there about particular
aspects of this proposal.

# This repo is for P4 language feature design discussions, not authoritative

The authoritative specification of the P4 language can be obtained
[here](https://p4.org/specs), and is maintained in source form in the
[p4-spec repository](https://github.com/p4lang/p4-spec).

This repository is for design discussions of adding a namespace
feature to the P4 programming language.  All statements made reflect
at most the opinions of their authors, and even they reserve the right
to change their minds later :-)

It is hoped that some of the results of this discussion will end up in
enhancements to a future version of the P4 programming language
specification, but as of 2021-Dec that is still only a hope.
